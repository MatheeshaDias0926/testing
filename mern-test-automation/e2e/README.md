# End-to-End Testing Documentation

This directory contains the end-to-end (E2E) testing setup for the mern-test-automation project. The E2E tests are designed to verify that the application behaves as expected from the user's perspective.

## Directory Structure

- **pages/**: Contains page object files that encapsulate the elements and actions for specific pages in the application.
- **tests/**: Contains the E2E test files that execute the tests for various user flows.
- **config/**: Contains configuration files for setting up the testing environment.

## Running the Tests

To run the end-to-end tests, navigate to the `e2e` directory and use the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Ensure that the server and client applications are running before executing the E2E tests.

## Test Framework

This project uses a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) for writing and executing the tests. Please refer to the individual test files for specific test cases and scenarios.
